American Generations Timeline
Though there is a consensus on the general time period for generations, there is not an agreement on the 
exact year that each generation begins and ends.


GI Generation:_
Born 1901-1924 (Age 90+)
They were teenagers during the Great Depression and fought in World War II. Sometimes called the greatest 
generation (following a book by journalist Tom Brokaw) or the swing generation because of their jazz music.


Silent Generation:-
Born 1925-1942 (Age 72-89)
They were too young to see action in World War II and too old to participate in the fun of the Summer of 
Love.This label describes their conformist tendencies and belief that following the rules was a sure ticket 
to success.


Baby Boomers:-
Born 1943-1964 (Age 50-71)
The boomers were born during an economic and baby boom following World War II. These hippie kids protested 
against the Vietnam War and participated in the civil rights movement, all with rock 'n' roll music blaring 
in the background.


Generation X:-
Born 1965-1979 (Age 35-49)
They were originally called the baby busters because fertility rates fell after the boomers.As teenagers,
they experienced the AIDs epidemic and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Sometimes called the MTV Generation,
the "X" in their name refers to this generation's desire not to be defined.


Millennials:-
Born 1980-2000 (Age 14-34)
They experienced the rise of the Internet, Sept. 11 and the wars that followed. Sometimes called Generation Y.
Because of their dependence on technology, they are said to be entitled and narcissistic.


Generation Z:-
Born 2001-2013 (Age 1-13)
These kids were the first born with the Internet and are suspected to be the most individualistic and
technology-dependent generation. Sometimes referred to as the iGeneration.
